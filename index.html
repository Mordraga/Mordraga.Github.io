    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <h4>Developer. Designer. Forever Learning</h4>
  
    <div class="ContentBoxes">
      <p>
        Hello! On a little more serious note,<br>
        I'm an aspiring full-stack developer currently studying web development and software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about creating intuitive, interactive, and accessible user experiences.
        I enjoy building small projects to learn new things, whether it’s making buttons grow, tracking clicks, or experimenting with game logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I want to develop games and apps that others enjoy using as much as I enjoy making them.
        Outside of code, I love storytelling like Dungeons and Dragons, strategy games, and finding creative ways to solve problems.
      </p>

    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <div class="ContentBoxes">
      <p>This site is mostly going to be used as a sudo-playground/portfolio for myself.<br>
      This is where I am going to keep all my projects, ideas, and just shenanigains for the time being while I learn full-stack development.
